# Conservation
This repository contains conservation-related work that I have done, including original research with the dataset.  I will continue to add content to this repository.

The final research project is an original experiment that I conducted to determine bird preferences for feeder color.  The data are also included as a csv file (BirdStudyData).

I have also included a Coursera certificat that I earned on Chimpanzee behavior and conservation, along with a poster I created for the course.

In this repository, I also have essays on conservation-related topics.
